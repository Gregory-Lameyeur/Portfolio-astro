"Mitrandi" is a professional project, which involves a rental property management website. My role included designing a REST API, creating a robust backend architecture, handling NoSQL database operations, and integrating external APIs. As a backend developer, I implemented these features using technologies such as AWS SES, WebSocket, Stripe, Jest, Supertest, AWS S3, Node.js, and MongoDB. In addition to development, I conducted thorough unit testing to ensure code quality. I also implemented a real-time chat feature to enhance client management.
