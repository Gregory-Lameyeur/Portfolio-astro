"Candles Shop" is a project created using React, TypeScript, and Bootstrap. It is a web application that showcases the use of these technologies to create a modern and responsive user interface. The choice of React ensures efficient component management and real-time interface updates, while TypeScript provides static type checking for robust code management.
