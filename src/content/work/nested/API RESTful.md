This is a RESTful API built using Node.js, Express.js, and TypeScript, designed to provide CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for user and product models. The API uses MongoDB as its database to store and retrieve data, and it also integrates user authentication and authorization through JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure login and registration processes.
