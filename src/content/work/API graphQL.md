This is a GraphQL API built using Node.js, serverless architecture, and AWS Lambda, designed to provide CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for articles, categories, and users in a blog application. The API uses MongoDB as its database to store and retrieve data, and it also integrates user authentication and authorization through JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure login and registration processes.
